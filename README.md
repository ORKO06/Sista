# Inspiration:

The obstacles that women face are largely societal and cultural. They act against women from the time they enter kindergarten—instilling in very young girls a belief they are less innately talented than their male peers—and persist into their work lives. Educational institutions—with undoubtedly many well-intentioned educators—are themselves complicit in reinforcing the hurdles. In order to dismantle these barriers, we likely need educators at all levels of education to examine their own biases and stereotypes.

Studies show 40% of the women leave STEM just within 5 years of starting. So even today where we are statistically to having over 50% women representation in undergraduate STEM degree programms we still have only 28 % women in actual jobs. So we are getting more girls in a bucket which is leaking.
So keeping women in STEM is more important than getting more girls in STEM.

# The problem it solves:
It aims to solve the problem ** Why do so many women leave their careers in STEM? **
followed by fixing the issues such as: 

* Problems of female education
* Lack of strong female role models
* Lack of workspace relationship
* Lack of mentorship and motivation
* Imposter Syndrome


# How Sista solves the problem?
Women comprise 29% of the STEM workforce. Looking at such statistics and indifference, women may feel that it will be very difficult for them to compete in this tech industry. In fact, women are 22% more likely to experience “Imposter Syndrome” In the workplace(the overwhelming feeling of being out of place compared to colleagues)
We want to bridge this gap thus we came up with a social media App named “Codhersgram” where women in STEM fields can connect to each other discuss projects, exchange ideas, share their problems, seek for collaboration to work on projects. “Codhersgram” has a feature of connection request where you can send friend requests to other fellow girls who are in the STEM fields, once they accept now you two are friends. Girls can now collaborate and form their own teams thus the issue of being leftover and ignored in a team of boys is now resolved. This will boost confidence in girls and they can fearlessly participate in various events and will feel comfortable in their workplace. Women of all ages and stripes will be able to network themselves through our web application. Thus we can find our women role models and inspirations. This will motivate other girls to work harder and reach the pinnacle of success. You seek mentorship from your role models by directly getting connected to them, and since women always stand for women she will definitely help you as she knows the barriers women generally faces.
One of the coolest features of our web application is that you can share your projects, ideas, thoughts through posts, reels. It will appear in the feed of your connections. They can like and comment which will help you to get feedback.

# Challenges we faced:


# Technologies used:
React, Node, MongoDB, Google cloud


* Figma: 
After brainstorming many ideas, we moved on to wireframing in Figma, starting with lo-fidelity and working together to create clickable interactions on the high fidelity prototype.

* Machine Learning: implemented K-Means Clustering Algorithm using python libraries : Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy.

* Front-end development using React.js

* Material-UI and CSS: 
we worked on the UI/UX, layout, CSS and design.


 
# Accomplishment:
✅We are proud that we were able to address such an important issue and find a practical and inclusive solution to it.
✅Our team work and cooperative workflow helped us to build the project in its entirety. 
✅We are proud to have completed the whole UI design, develop and publish a fully functional website and developed a ML model.


 
# Learning Achievements: 
 
 
# What’s next for Sista:
We want to add more functionality and flexibility to our web application. Integrating Machine learning model to our application with dataset of people with common interest. We would like to approach women tech leaders, volunteers who are passionate about women in STEM, and organizations for collaboration so that they can support and mentor women through our web application. We plan to add a chat server API.
